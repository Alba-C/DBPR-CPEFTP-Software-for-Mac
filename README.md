# DBPR-CPEFTP-Software-for-Mac

The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulations (DBPR) requires all registed education providers to upload student credit via FTP.  However the software the state provides is for windows only.  This software attempts to mirror the feel and functionality of the windows software, for mac users.  

A copy of the original windows only software guide can be found at http://www.myfloridalicense.com/dbpr/servop/testing/documents/report_tool.pdf?x40199
